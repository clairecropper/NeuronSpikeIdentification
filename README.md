### Abstract:
Epilepsy, a prevalent neurological disorder, impacts millions globally. Despite the array of treatments available, a significant number of patients remain non-responsive. This project involves the development of a machine learning algorithm using PCA and optimized K-means that will accurately detect and identify the brain activity, or neuron spikes, that indicate active seizure activity. The creation of an app front-end allows for the seizure activity to be visualized, for any relevant parameters to be adjusted as necessary either as a method for analysis following the collection.
